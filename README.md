The frontend of the Task Tracker is built using React.js and React Router for seamless navigation. It includes pages and components to add, edit, delete, and filter tasks by status (completed or incomplete). The UI is responsive and interacts with the backend via fetch to perform CRUD operations using RESTful APIs.
